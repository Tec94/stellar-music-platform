## 4. Screen Reader Audit

### 4.1 NVDA (Windows + Firefox)

- Landmarks: Header (banner), Navigation, Main, Footer all announced
- Skip link announced and works correctly
- Navigation menu button exposes `aria-expanded` state
- Dialogs announced with titles & descriptions
- Gallery items read as "View [name] image/video"
- Tutorial status updates announced via live region
- Chat status and incoming messages announced (polite live region)
- Form errors announced via `role="alert"`

### 4.2 VoiceOver (macOS + Safari)

- Rotor shows correct headings and landmarks
- Focus order matches visual order
- Dialogs correctly labeled, rotor shows "Dialog"
- Skip link appears as first element
- Gallery lightbox controls recognized; VO + Space triggers actions
- Reduced motion respected when setting is enabled

---

## 5. Focus Management Verification

| Component | Requirement | Result |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Tutorial Modal | Focus moves to modal, trapped, Escape closes, focus returns to trigger | ✅ |
| Quest Dialog | Same as above | ✅ |
| Gallery Lightbox | Same as above | ✅ |
| Tier Requirements Dialog | Same as above | ✅ |
| Mobile Navigation | Focus remains within when open; Escape closes | ✅ |

All dialogs now use the shared `useFocusTrap` hook to enforce focus trapping, Escape handling, and focus restoration.

---

## 6. Dynamic Content & Live Regions

| Component | Live Region | Behavior | Result |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Chat status | `role="status"` | Connection changes announced | ✅ |
| Chat messages | `aria-live="polite"` + `aria-relevant="additions"` | New messages announced | ✅ |
| Tutorial progress | `aria-live="polite"` | Step changes announced | ✅ |
| Tutorial completion | `role="status"` | Completion message announced | ✅ |
| Tier redirect status | Visually hidden `role="status"` | Checkout redirect announced | ✅ |
| Form errors | `role="alert"` | Validation errors announced immediately | ✅ |

## 7. Visual & Contrast Checks

- Verified all buttons, links, text against light and dark backgrounds
- Ghost button updated to solid background (`#dbeafe`) for contrast 7.8:1
- Form borders updated to `#94a3b8` (contrast 3.2:1 against white)
- Focus indicators: 2px outline `#1d4ed8` (light surfaces) / `#facc15` (dark surfaces)
- Tested at 200% zoom and 400% zoom; layout reflows without horizontal scroll
- High contrast mode (Windows) shows clear outlines & text

See [Color Contrast Audit](./color-contrast-audit.md) for full measurements.

---

## 8. Reduced Motion Validation

- Enabled `prefers-reduced-motion` in OS
- Verified button hover animations disabled (no translate/box-shadow changes)
- Dialogs appear without fade/scale animations
- Scroll behavior instantaneous (no smooth scrolling)
- No autoplaying media; gallery previews muted and non-interactive

---

## 9. Regression Testing Checklist

Updates verified against the following checklist:

- [x] Skip navigation link present and functional
- [x] Mobile nav button exposes `aria-expanded`
- [x] Focus indicators visible across all components
- [x] Dialogs trap focus and close on Escape
- [x] Focus returns to trigger after dialog close
- [x] Gallery items fully keyboard accessible
- [x] Live regions announce status changes (chat, tiers, tutorial)
- [x] Reduced-motion users protected from animations
- [x] Registration flow announces step context
- [x] Image alt text descriptive (filenames normalized)

## 10. Resolved Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Gallery items were not keyboard accessible (`<article>` with `onClick`) | Replaced with `<button>` elements, added ARIA labels, focus styles, and lightbox improvements |
| Dialogs lacked focus management | Implemented `useFocusTrap` hook for all dialogs/lightbox/mobile nav |
| No skip navigation link | Added `.skip-link` at top of layout targeting `#main-content` |
| Mobile menu lacked `aria-expanded` and Escape handling | Added `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, and Escape key support with focus return |
| Focus indicators relied on browser defaults | Introduced custom `:focus-visible` outlines with WCAG-compliant colors |
| Ghost button low contrast | Updated to solid background (`#dbeafe`) with high-contrast text |
| Form borders low contrast | Increased border contrast to `#94a3b8`, added focus border change |
| Live announcements missing for chat, tiers, tutorial | Added `aria-live` regions and status messaging |
| Reduced-motion unsupported | Added global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` overrides |
| Registration steps unclear for screen readers | Added live announcement and form labels for each step |

## 11. Recommendations / Next Steps

1. Maintain accessibility checks in CI (Lighthouse ≥ 90)
2. Re-run manual screen reader testing quarterly or after major UI changes
3. Expand video support with captions/transcripts in future roadmap
4. Consider dark mode implementation with WCAG AA contrast verification
5. Provide printable accessibility quick reference for design/engineering teams
