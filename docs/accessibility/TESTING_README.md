## 🧪 Running Tests

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Lint check (includes accessibility rules)
npm run lint

# Build and run Lighthouse audit
npm run build
npm run qa:performance

# Run unit/integration tests
npm test

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Manual Tests

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Tab through all pages
   - Verify focus indicators visible
   - Test Escape key in dialogs
   - Try skip navigation link

2. **Screen Reader:**
   - Open NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (macOS)
   - Navigate through pages
   - Verify announcements
   - Check form labels and errors

3. **Color Contrast:**
   - Use browser DevTools contrast checker
   - Test with high contrast mode
   - Verify focus indicators

4. **Reduced Motion:**
   - Enable `prefers-reduced-motion` in OS
   - Verify animations are minimized

## 🏆 Best Practices

### When Developing New Features

1. **Start Accessible:** Use semantic HTML from the start
2. **Test Early:** Run Lighthouse during development
3. **Keyboard First:** Ensure keyboard navigation works before mouse
4. **Label Everything:** All interactive elements need clear labels
5. **Contrast Matters:** Use approved color tokens
6. **Screen Reader Check:** Test with NVDA/VoiceOver before merging
7. **Live Regions:** Use for dynamic content updates
8. **Focus Management:** Handle focus in dialogs and dynamic content

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Semantic HTML elements used
- [ ] All buttons/links keyboard accessible
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] ARIA attributes correct
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- [ ] Alt text on images
- [ ] Form labels associated
- [ ] Live regions for updates
- [ ] Tested with screen reader
- [ ] Lighthouse score ≥ 90
